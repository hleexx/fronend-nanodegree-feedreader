# Feed Reader Testing Overview

Udacity gave me a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of the application included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) to test the application and had already started writing their first test suite, but they moved on to start their own company and forgot to complete testing. So I had the challenge of completing the test suite. This instructional project focuses on practicing the standard of development known as "test-driven development" to ensure that web-based applications pass the tests before releasing it into the hands of users.
